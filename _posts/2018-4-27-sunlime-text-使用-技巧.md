24. Switching Lines

Have you ever written code, only to realize that certain lines are out of order? ST3 has a time-saving shortcut that lets you move a given line up or down in a document. CTRL-SHIFT-UP (PC) or CTRL-⌘-UP (Mac) moves a line up, while CTRL-SHIFT-DOWN (PC) or CTRL-⌘-DOWN (Mac) moves a line down.

25. Deleting Lines

For the times when a line of code isn’t out of order, but needs to simply be removed, ST3 has handy shortcut for deleting lines without having to select the entire line. CTRL-SHIFT-K (PC and Mac) will delete the current line your cursor is on.
