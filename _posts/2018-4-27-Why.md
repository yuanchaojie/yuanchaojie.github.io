why

### Why can't UIView be copied? What is the reason?

```
UIView* view2 = [view1 copy]; //view1 existed
UIView* view2 = [view1 retain]; //view1 existed

```

**原因**：The reason is that UIView does not implement the copying protocol, and therefore there is no copyWithZone selector in UIView.

**深copy一个view的方法**


```
id copyOfView = 
[NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:[NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:originalView]];

```
